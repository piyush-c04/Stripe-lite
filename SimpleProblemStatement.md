🟢 First — What’s the Problem?

Imagine you are building a SaaS startup (like Netflix, Canva, or even a small edtech app).
You want to charge users monthly or yearly.

But…

How do you remember to bill them every month?

How do you send proper invoices that follow Indian GST (tax) rules?

What if your customer is from the USA — you need multi-currency support.

What if the payment fails — you need to retry or suspend the account.

👉 Currently, startups either integrate Stripe (works well in the US) or Razorpay (for India), but they still need to handle:

Subscription logic (plans, upgrades, downgrades)

Taxes (GST in India, VAT in EU, no tax in US)

Multi-tenant setup (different businesses using the same engine)

So, you’re building a backend service that makes all of this easy.

🟢 Step 2 — What Does “Multi-Tenant” Mean?

Multi-tenant = one system that serves multiple businesses at the same time.

Example:

A SaaS tool (like Zoho, Freshworks) doesn’t create separate servers for each company.

Instead, one system runs for everyone, but keeps data isolated.

👉 In your project: One backend handles billing for 100 startups.
Startup A’s invoices are not visible to Startup B — but both use the same system.

🟢 Step 3 — Features a Rookie Backend Dev Can Build

Let’s list small features you can aim for:

Subscription Plans

Example: Basic (₹500/month), Pro (₹2000/month).

Store plan details in PostgreSQL.

Customer Accounts

Each tenant (business) has multiple customers.

Store customer details, payment method.

Invoices & Payments

When monthly billing day comes → system generates invoice.

Calls payment gateway API (Razorpay/Stripe).

Marks invoice as paid/unpaid.

Taxes (Simple GST)

If customer is in India, add 18% GST.

If customer is abroad, skip GST.

Retry Logic

If payment fails, retry 2–3 times before canceling subscription.

Can use Cloud Functions (serverless cron jobs) for retries.

Tenant Isolation

Each tenant’s data has a tenant_id.

Queries always filter by tenant_id.


🟢 Step 4 — Architecture (Simple Picture in Words)

Think of 3 layers:

Frontend (Optional): Dashboard for tenants (businesses) → to create plans, view invoices.

Backend (Core): FastAPI app

REST APIs:

POST /tenants → register a business

POST /plans → create subscription plan

POST /subscribe → add a customer to a plan

POST /invoice/generate → generate invoice

Talks to payment gateway APIs.

Stores everything in PostgreSQL.

Background Jobs (using Kafka/RabbitMQ or Celery):

Cron job checks “who needs to be billed today”

Generates invoice, pushes job → “try payment”

Handles retries.

Cloud/Scaling:

Put backend in Docker container

Deploy on AWS ECS / GCP Cloud Run

Use Lambda for retry logic

Database: Managed PostgreSQ
