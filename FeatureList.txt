 (**Multi-Tenant Billing & Subscription Engine**) step by step — like how a backend/DevOps/cloud engineer would approach it.

---

## **1. Problem Restatement**

Startups and SaaS companies in India (and globally) need to charge their customers on a **recurring basis** (monthly, yearly). This requires:

* Handling **subscriptions** (plans, upgrades, downgrades).
* Generating **invoices automatically**.
* Applying **tax rules (like GST in India, VAT in EU)**.
* Managing **multiple customers (tenants)** in one system.
* Supporting **multiple payment methods and currencies**.

Today, services like Stripe do this, but they’re not always optimized for India’s GST compliance or for startups that want something lightweight.

## **2. Key Concepts (Explained Simply)**

* **Subscription Plans:** Like Netflix monthly/yearly plans. Your system must allow startups to define their own “plans” (Basic ₹500/month, Premium ₹1000/month).
* **Multi-Tenant:** One backend serving many businesses (tenants). Each tenant = one startup using your service, but isolated data.
* **Recurring Billing:** Automatic monthly charges without manual effort.
* **Invoices:** Auto-generated bills sent to customers (PDF/Email).
* **Compliance:** Apply GST rules automatically (e.g., 18% tax in India).

## **3. Core Features**

1. **Tenant Management**

   * Each startup signs up → gets an isolated account/workspace.
   * Their customers, invoices, and payments are stored separately.

2. **Plan & Subscription Engine**

   * Define product → Define plans (monthly, yearly, custom pricing).
   * Customers subscribe → System tracks renewal dates.

3. **Billing Job Engine**

   * Cron jobs (scheduled tasks) or queues trigger “charge customer” at renewal time.
   * Retry if payment fails.

4. **Invoice & Tax Handling**

   * Generate invoice with correct tax (GST, VAT, sales tax).
   * Send to customer via email + PDF.

5. **Payment Gateway Integration**

   * Integrate Razorpay/Stripe/PayPal.
   * Handle webhooks for payment success/failure.

6. **Analytics Dashboard**

   * Revenue tracking.
   * Churn (customers leaving).
   * Failed payments.

## **4. Tech Architecture**

**Backend Tech Stack:**

* **FastAPI** → REST APIs for subscription/billing workflows.
* **PostgreSQL** → Stores tenants, plans, subscriptions, invoices.
* **Redis / Kafka / RabbitMQ** → For handling billing jobs & retries.
* **Celery/Worker Service** → Executes background jobs (e.g., billing customers at midnight).
* **Docker + Kubernetes** → Each microservice containerized and deployed.
* **AWS/GCP/Azure** → For scaling, queues, and cloud functions.

**High-Level Flow:**

1. Tenant registers → creates plans.
2. Customer subscribes → entry saved in DB.
3. Billing job scheduled → checks “due subscriptions” → charges customer via Razorpay.
4. Payment success → generate invoice + send email.
5. Payment failure → retry with exponential backoff.

## **5. Why Impressive**

* **Multi-Tenant Design:** Real SaaS-level challenge (separating data securely).
* **Recurring Jobs & Queues:** Shows backend job scheduling knowledge.
* **Compliance (GST):** Tackles India-specific real-world complexity.
* **Cloud Native Deployment:** Proves DevOps + backend strength.
* **Scalable:** Can support 100s of startups using the same engine.

👉 In short, this is not just “another project” — it’s like building a **mini-Stripe backend**, which is a **serious, real-world problem** startups face.
